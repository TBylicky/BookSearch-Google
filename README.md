# BookSearch-Google
This is a simple search page using Google Books API that runs mostly through javascript.  The webpage itself is designed using standard html and css elements.  Search terms are provided by users and display on the web browser.  You can search by title or author, and specify search type according to relevance or publication date.

I found few examples online as to how Google Books API functioned (even their own website had limited examples), so I figured I would write my own.
